# Bayesian Statistical Analysis with Python

Come check out the [notebook](https://ericmjl.github.io/bayesian-stats-talk/)!

In this talk, we will cover how to do Bayesian statistical analysis using Python and PyMC3. We will cover the most common statistical analysis tasks: **parameter estimation** and **treatment comparison**. Under each analysis task, we will cover two simple examples that illuminate key aspects of Bayesian data analysis.
